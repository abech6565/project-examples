# Project Examples
Portfolio of various analytics, modeling, and data science projects. 

Each project contains a codefile and a presentation specifically identified to showcase different technical and strategic abilities. 

Most of the analyses here are completed with R, but Python analogues are available.

### Example 1: Consumer Card Complaints Analysis 
*Text Mining, Data Frame Manipulation*
- This project utilized text-mining techniques in R on a publicly available dataset. The data contains complaints filed with the Federal Consumer Watchdog agencies for two of the largest credit card issuers in the United States.
- Analyzed complaint themes using topic clustering, word correlation, and regular expressions.
- Included visualizations and summaries to recommend strategies to a hypothetical audience.

### Example 2: Applying Advanced Analytics to Credit Risk Modeling 
*Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM, K-means, xGBoost, Random Forest*
- This project took another publicly available dataset and compared baseline modeling methods with ensemble techniques.
- The data used is for a mortgage portfolio and covers roughly 50,000 loans over a 10+ year time frame.
- Built and tuned several supervised/unsupervised models.
- Performed feature selection, evaluated model performance, and created both visuals and written analysis to evaluate results.

### Example 3: Credit Risk Strategy 
*Logistic Regression, Strategy, Cost-Benefit Analysis*
- This project used a publicly available dataset to build a logistic regression to predict the probability that a customer would default on a loan product.
- Quantified tradeoff between predictive improvement and data acquisition cost.
- Included classification accuracy measures & derivations, including ROC, threshold values, etc.

### Example 4 Simulation of Bond Prices with Monte Carlo Markov Chains 
- Explored the use of Monte Carlo Markov Chains in bond pricing.
- Code is intentionally verbose and iterative for instructive purposes.

### Example 5: Three Statement Financial Model for $SLM Stock
- This file contains a three-statement (excel-based) forecast for $SLM.
- Forecast includes drivers, assumptions, and key financial metrics.
