## Project Examples
Portfolio of various analytics, modeling, and data science projects. 

Each project contains a codefile and a presentation specifically identified to showcase different analytical abilities. 

Most of the analyses here are completed with R, but Python analogues are available.

### Example 1: Consumer Card Complaints Analysis (Data Mining) 
This project utilized text-mining techniques in R on a publicly available dataset. The data contains complaints filed with the Federal Consumer Watchdog agencies for two of the largest credit card issuers in the United States. The slides contain visuals to showcase the results of the analysis and the codefiles contain both the text analytics and code used to create summary statistics.

### Example 2: Applying Advanced Analytics to Credit Risk Modeling (Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM, K-means, xGBoost, Random Forest)
This project took another publicly available dataset and compared baseline modeling methods with ensemble techniques. The data used is for a mortgage portfolio and covers roughly 50,000 loans over a 10+ year time frame. The analysis built several statistical models, performed variable selection and hyperparameter tuning, and analyzed/compared their results. A powerpoint, written analysis, and codefile are provided.

### Example 3: Credit Risk Strategy (Logistic Regression, Strategy)
This project used a publicly available dataset to build a logistic regression to predict the probability that a customer would default on a loan product. This project was designed in a way to evaluate the cost/benefit of potentially expanding a hypothetical company's access to additional data attributes. It compared the hypothetical cost of those new attributes against the incremental loss captured by implementing them in a model. This tradeoff thinking is something I've encountered a few times in my career and wanted to showcase.
