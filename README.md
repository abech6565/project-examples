# Project Examples
Portfolio of various analytics, modeling, and data science projects. 

Each project contains a codefile and a presentation specifically identified to showcase different analytical abilities. 

Most of the analyses here are completed with R, but Python analogues are available.

### Example 1: Consumer Card Complaints Analysis 
*Text Mining, Data Frame Manipulation*
- This project utilized text-mining techniques in R on a publicly available dataset.
--- The data contains complaints filed with the Federal Consumer Watchdog agencies for two of the largest credit card issuers in the United States.
- Analyzed complaint themes using topic clustering, word correlation, and regular expressions.
- Included visualizations and summaries to recommend strategies to a hypothetical audience.

### Example 2: Applying Advanced Analytics to Credit Risk Modeling (Linear/Logistic Regression, SVM, K-means, xGBoost, Random Forest)
This project took another publicly available dataset and compared baseline modeling methods with ensemble techniques. The data used is for a mortgage portfolio and covers roughly 50,000 loans over a 10+ year time frame. The analysis built several statistical models, performed variable selection and hyperparameter tuning, and analyzed/compared their results. A powerpoint, written analysis, and codefile are provided.

### Example 3: Credit Risk Strategy (Logistic Regression, Strategy)
This project used a publicly available dataset to build a logistic regression to predict the probability that a customer would default on a loan product. This project was designed in a way to evaluate the cost/benefit of potentially expanding a hypothetical company's access to additional data attributes. It compared the hypothetical cost of those new attributes against the incremental loss captured by implementing them in a model. This tradeoff thinking is something I've encountered a few times in my career and wanted to showcase.

### Example 4 Simulation of Bond Prices with Monte Carlo Markov Chains 
This research project demonstrated and explored the use of Monte Carlo Markov Chains in bond pricing. The project contains a research paper with a codefile. The codefile is fairly ... rudimentary. For demonstrative purposes (as part of the study), I wanted to be able to access each iteration of the chain states to show how the chain operates to several colleagues. Normally, I'd write it in a much more simplified loop.

### Example 5: Three Statement Financial Model for $SLM Stock
This file contains a three-statement (excel-based) forecast for $SLM. It contains a forecast for the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Statement of Cash flows as well as commonly accepted metrics.
