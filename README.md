## Project Examples
Portfolio of various analytics, modeling, and data science projects. 

Each project contains a codefile and a presentation specifically identified to showcase different analytical abilities. 

Most of the analyses here are completed with R, but Python analogues are available.

## Example 1: Consumer Card Complaints Analysis
This project utilized text-mining techniques in R on a publicly available dataset. The data contains complaints filed with the Federal Consumer Watchdog agencies for two of the largest credit card issuers in the United States. The slides contain visuals to showcase the results of the analysis and the codefiles contain both the text analytics and code used to create summary statistics.
